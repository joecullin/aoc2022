## Previous years

* 2018
    * I was minimally competent in nodejs, and forced myself to use this as a learning experience. Struggled with promises & async flow. Gave up after day 9.

* 2019:
    * Comfortable in node by now, but still learning. Stopped after day 16 due to other demands on my time.

* 2020:
    * Got all 50 stars! Some of the later puzzles were tough, though!

* 2021:
    * Packed into a stressful month, and I didn't have the motivation to push through at the end. Still fun though!
