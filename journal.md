# Misc notes & thoughts.

I'm in a private leaderboard with some https://www.barracuda.com/ colleagues.

## Day 5

This input makes me wish I'd chosen to do the challenges in Perl this year :)

## Day 4

One limit I impose on myself: try not to use any npm modules for solving the puzzle. It makes it a little more interesting to work out some basic stuff, and to learn more of the built-in javascript functions & node idioms.

I've really wished I had some good "set math" functions these past couple days though.

## Setup

Copied repo from last year, removed all the input & solution files (kept only 01.1), and removed unused modules.
