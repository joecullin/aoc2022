# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2022

I'm logging some notes & thoughts in [journal.md](journal.md).

Initial setup:
```
npm install
```

Run a puzzle, for example the second part of day one:
```
./run.js --puzzle=1.2
```

My inputs are used by default.
If you want to use a different input, specify a file with the `--input` parameter.
```
./run.js --puzzle=1.2 --input=./inputs/01.sample.txt
```

Since I usually work on these in vi, the one thing I miss from vscode is the instant linting. I usually run like this:
```
npm run lint && ./run.js --puzzle=1.2 --input=./inputs/01.sample.txt
```

## Previous years

* 2018
    * I was minimally competent in nodejs, and forced myself to use this as a learning experience. Struggled with promises & async flow. Gave up after day 9.

    * Comfortable in node by now, but still learning. Stopped after day 16 due to other demands on my time.

* 2021:
    * Packed into a very busy month, and I didn't have the motivation to push through at the end. Still fun though!
